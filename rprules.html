Random Death Match (RDM)

Players directly harming your life, property and/or freedom may be killed without warning.
Raids and hits can be completed by killing without warning.
All other cases require a valid 10 second warning, including a clear set of instructions, delivered through typed chat. It is the full responsibility of the person giving the warning to ensure all intended targets are aware of the warning. If the target has completed the instructions in full, you may not kill them. The action to be completed and the amount of time they have to complete the said action shall be included in all 10 second warnings for the warning to be valid.
Group warnings shall only be authorized for 10 second leave warnings.
Example: Drop 1k or die you have 10 seconds. | Leave or die you have 10 seconds.
If a target of which a warning and/or inducing action is being directed too shows hostile intent OR ignorance of the instruction, such as but not limited to specifically pulling out a weapon (and not the other way around), escaping, un-holstering a weapon, etc. then action can be made instant.
Examples of Inducing Actions: Stunsticking, Raping, Mugging, Pimp Slapping, and etc.
The mayor may not be killed during Mayor Grace for any reason. Mayors Grace is voided by the Mayor executing anything RP related beyond what is done automatically (like default laws)
You also may not camp the mayors office during his grace with the purpose of killing him afterwards.
Metagaming <br>

Your character may not use information beyond its knowledge and beyond its current life. This includes but is not limited to any form of revenge killing, warrant, wanting, or demoting
Props and Entities

Prop/Entity/Door spamming, blocking, climbing, surfing, and minging is not allowed.
Do not spawn props/move props inside of other players’ bases, do not do it during raids, and do not do it inside of a server event.
Building abnormally large bases or other RP-restricting structures (i.e pointless things blocking more than 50% of the road/sidewalk) will result in them being removed. Pointless is described as something that adds nothing to the RP value or gameplay, staff hold discretion ~ some examples being Art, Houses with no purpose, Buildings with no purpose, Minge Builds, etc.
Basing and Building

You may have a building sign (using textscreen) to isolate and protect yourself from the RP world provided you do not have any raidables, and you are not engaging in role-play. It must be removed when you are finished.
The maximum amount of fading doors per base is three.
A keypad to a fading door must be clearly identifiable.
Bases cannot force players to crouch, jump, crouch jump, or precision walk at any location within.
Fading bridges and sky-constructions are not allowed.
Base entrances as well as the overall inner layout must be absolutely clear and concise. (i.e mazes, traps, puzzles, etc.)
You may not build anywhere in the vicinity of the main intersection point in front of spawn, nor may you build anywhere on the immediate sidewalks directly adjacent the spawn entrances/exits :: Danktown / C18
RP Relation

You are free to protect players that you have RP relationship with (the first rule of RDM extends to these people).
Ways to be RP related:
Job/Class – This takes precedence over all other RP relation. You must also follow all class rules before considering RP relation.
Owning the same base - You may only protect those within the vicinity of your base.
Organization – An organization can be made for $50,000 .
Hired/Working Together – You must be either hired through F4, or have your job name set as: /job "with person/org name here*"
Customer Relationship – Whilst performing your transaction you have RP relation with your customer
Raiding, Mugging, and Hostage Taking

You (and those RP related with you) must wait 10 minutes before performing these actions on the same person, base, or organization. This does not apply to Police Officers re-raiding bases for illegal infractions or players raiding out of jail by means of escaping.
Mugging

Maximum $1,000
Must grant victims 10 seconds to oblige unless they are escaping
Any signs of hostile intent from the victim (taking out weaponry) is KOS, this does NOT include if the victim already has a weapon out.
Any signs of clear clear clear clear CLEAR attempts of escape from the victim renders them KOS
Hostage Taking

Hostage ransom cannot exceed $10,000.
Raiding

Once you’ve completed your raid, you must leave immediately. You cannot occupy the base.
Absolutely anyone is KOS in the raid zone (defined as a 5 shoulder-to-shoulder length from any entrance/exit/wall ~ props included). Non-Government jobs do not follow this, they have different raid zone guidelines.
Leaving the raid zone at any point during the raid activates your raid timer, and you may not come back.
If it is obvious that there are no raidables
